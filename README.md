# Light-Swarm-Project-ESP8266-Raspberry-Pi-UDP-Master-Election-System
ESP8266 devices broadcast light sensor readings over UDP multicast. The Raspberry Pi identifies the device with the highest reading as the "master," flashes corresponding LEDs, logs master transitions, and displays real-time graphs using Matplotlib.
